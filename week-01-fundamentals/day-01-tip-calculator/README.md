# Tip Calculator: Your First Programming Challenge ðŸ§®

## ðŸŽ¯ Problem Statement
Create a program that calculates the tip for a restaurant bill and returns the total amount to pay.

**Input:** Bill amount (number)
**Output:** Total amount to pay (bill + tip)

---

## ðŸ§  THINK BEFORE YOU CODE!

### Step 1: Understand the Problem
- What information do I need? 
- What should I calculate?
- What should I return?

### Step 2: Plan Your Approach
Before writing ANY code, answer these questions:

1. **What's the formula for calculating a tip?**
   - Tip = Bill Ã— Tip Percentage
   - Total = Bill + Tip

2. **What tip percentage should I use?**
   - Standard: 15%, 18%, or 20%
   - Let's start with 18% (0.18)

3. **What are my inputs and outputs?**
   - Input: `billAmount` (number)
   - Output: `totalAmount` (number)

4. **What's my step-by-step algorithm?**
   - Step 1: _______________
   - Step 2: _______________
   - Step 3: _______________

### Step 3: Consider Edge Cases
- What if the bill is $0?
- What if the bill is negative?
- Should I round the result?

### Step 4: Test Your Logic (Before Coding!)
Work through these examples by hand:
- Bill: $50 â†’ Tip: $9 â†’ Total: $59
- Bill: $100 â†’ Tip: $18 â†’ Total: $118
- Bill: $25.50 â†’ Tip: $4.59 â†’ Total: $30.09

## ðŸš€ Programming Challenges

### Challenge 1: Basic Calculator
Create a function that:
- Takes a bill amount
- Calculates 18% tip
- Returns the total

### Challenge 2: Flexible Tip Calculator  
Enhance your function to:
- Accept both bill amount AND tip percentage
- Handle different tip rates (15%, 18%, 20%, etc.)

### Challenge 3: Detailed Receipt
Create a function that returns an object/class with:
- Original bill amount
- Tip amount
- Total amount
- Tip percentage used

### Challenge 4: Input Validation
Add error handling for:
- Negative bill amounts
- Invalid tip percentages
- Non-numeric inputs

## ðŸŽ¯ Learning Objectives

By completing this exercise, you should be able to:
- [ ] Break down a problem into steps
- [ ] Write pseudocode before real code
- [ ] Test your logic manually first
- [ ] Handle edge cases
- [ ] Write clean, readable functions

## ðŸ¤” Reflection Questions

After you code your solution, ask yourself:
1. Did I understand the problem correctly?
2. Does my solution handle edge cases?
3. Is my code readable and well-organized?
4. What would I do differently next time?

**Remember: The goal is to build your problem-solving process, not just get the right answer!**
