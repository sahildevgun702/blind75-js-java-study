# Thinking Challenges: Problem Analysis Practice üß©

## üéØ Goal
Practice analyzing problems BEFORE coding. This builds your "programmer's intuition."

## üî¨ Challenge 1: Detective Work

### Problem Statement:
```
Write a function that checks if two strings are anagrams of each other.
An anagram is a word formed by rearranging the letters of another word.

Example: "listen" and "silent" are anagrams.
```

### Your Detective Work:
**Before reading ANY solutions online, answer these:**

1. **What exactly is an anagram?**
   - _______________________________________________

2. **What are the inputs?**
   - _______________________________________________

3. **What should I return?**
   - _______________________________________________

4. **What makes two words anagrams?**
   - _______________________________________________

5. **What's the simplest way to check this?**
   - _______________________________________________

6. **What are some edge cases?**
   - Empty strings: _______________
   - Different lengths: _______________
   - Same string twice: _______________

7. **What if I sort both strings?**
   - _______________________________________________

8. **What if I count the letters in each?**
   - _______________________________________________

## üîç Challenge 2: Pattern Recognition

### Problem Statement:
```
Given an array of integers, find all pairs that sum to a target value.
Return the count of such pairs.

Example: nums = [1, 2, 3, 2, 4], target = 5
Answer: 2 (pairs: (1,4) and (2,3))
```

### Pattern Analysis:
**Identify the pattern by answering:**

1. **What am I searching for?**
   - _______________________________________________

2. **How is this similar to "Two Sum"?**
   - _______________________________________________

3. **How is this different from "Two Sum"?**
   - _______________________________________________

4. **What approach worked for Two Sum?**
   - _______________________________________________

5. **Can I use the same approach here?**
   - _______________________________________________

6. **What's the brute force approach?**
   - Step 1: _______________
   - Step 2: _______________
   - Step 3: _______________

7. **Can I optimize using a hash map?**
   - _______________________________________________

```

### Think of 3 Different Approaches:

**Approach 1: _____________**
- How it works: _______________________________________________
- Time complexity: _______________
- Space complexity: _______________

**Approach 2: _____________**
- How it works: _______________________________________________
- Time complexity: _______________
- Space complexity: _______________

**Approach 3: _____________**
- How it works: _______________________________________________

## üß† Challenge 4: Problem Decomposition

### Problem Statement:
```
Given a string, find the longest substring without repeating characters.

Example: "abcabcbb" ‚Üí "abc" (length 3)
```

### Break It Down:
**Decompose this complex problem:**

1. **What's a substring?**
   - _______________________________________________

2. **What does "without repeating characters" mean?**
   - _______________________________________________

3. **How would I check if a substring has repeating characters?**
   - _______________________________________________

4. **What's the brute force approach?**
   - Step 1: _______________
   - Step 2: _______________
   - Step 3: _______________
   - Step 4: _______________

5. **What pattern might help optimize this?**
   - Hint: Think about "windows" of characters
   - _______________________________________________

6. **When should I expand my "window"?**
   - _______________________________________________

7. **When should I shrink my "window"?**
   - _______________________________________________

## üéØ Challenge 5: Edge Case Detective

### Problem Statement:
```
Write a function to reverse a linked list.
```

### Edge Case Investigation:
**Think of all the ways this could break:**

1. **What if the linked list is empty?**
   - Input: _______________
   - Expected output: _______________

2. **What if there's only one node?**
   - Input: _______________
   - Expected output: _______________

3. **What if there are two nodes?**
   - Input: _______________
   - Expected output: _______________

4. **What's the normal case?**
   - Input: _______________
   - Expected output: _______________

5. **What could go wrong during reversal?**
   - Problem 1: _______________
   - Problem 2: _______________

6. **What information do I need to keep track of?**
   - _______________________________________________

## üèÜ Self-Assessment

Rate yourself (1-5) on each skill:

- [ ] I can identify inputs/outputs clearly ___/5
- [ ] I can spot the problem type/pattern ___/5  
- [ ] I can think of multiple approaches ___/5
- [ ] I consider edge cases naturally ___/5
- [ ] I break complex problems into steps ___/5

**Total Score: ___/25**

**If you scored 20+ points:** You're ready for the next level!
**If you scored 15-19 points:** Review the concepts and try again.

## üéÆ Bonus Challenge: Teach Back

**The Ultimate Test of Understanding:**

Pick one problem from above and:
1. Explain it to someone else (or record yourself)
2. Walk through your analysis step-by-step
3. Show them how you'd approach it

If you can teach it, you truly understand it! üéì

**Remember:** The goal isn't to solve these problems perfectly - it's to build your analytical thinking process. Every expert was once a beginner who took time to think things through!
