# Problem Analysis Fundamentals üîç

## Learning Objective
Master the art of **understanding a problem completely** before writing any code.

---

## üéØ The Problem Analysis Framework

### Step 1: Read and Reread
- Read the problem statement 3 times
- Highlight or underline key words
- Look for constraints and requirements

### Step 2: Identify the Components

#### **Inputs**
- What data am I given?
- What format is the data in?
- Any size limitations?

#### **Outputs** 
- What exactly should I return?
- What format should the output be in?
- What does "success" look like?

#### **Constraints**
- What are the rules I must follow?
- What am I NOT allowed to do?
- Time/space complexity requirements?

### Step 3: Pattern Recognition
Ask yourself:
- What type of problem is this?
- Have I seen something similar before?
- What approach usually works for this pattern?

### Problem 1: Two Sum Analysis
```
Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, 
return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.
```

**Your Analysis Practice:**

**Inputs:**
- _________________ (fill this in)
- _________________ 

**Outputs:**
- _________________ 

**Constraints:**
- _________________
- _________________

**Problem Type:**

### Problem 2: Contains Duplicate Analysis
```
Given an integer array nums, return true if any value appears 
at least twice in the array, and return false if every element is distinct.
```

**Your Analysis Practice:**

**Inputs:**
- _________________ 

**Outputs:**
- _________________ 

**Key Question:** What am I really checking for?
- _________________

**Constraints:**
- _________________

**Problem Type:**
- _________________

**Approach Ideas:**

## üß† Thinking Questions

Before looking at ANY problem solution, ask yourself:

### Understanding Questions:
1. "What is this problem really asking me to do?"
2. "Can I explain this problem to someone else in simple terms?"
3. "What would the output look like for a simple example?"

### Approach Questions:
1. "What's the most obvious (brute force) way to solve this?"
2. "Can I make it more efficient by storing information?"
3. "What data structure would help me here?"

### Testing Questions:
1. "What would happen with an empty input?"
2. "What about with just one element?"
3. "What's the largest input I should consider?"

## üé™ Interactive Exercise: Problem Breakdown

### Exercise 1: The "Explain to a Friend" Test

Pick any problem and try to explain it as if you're talking to a friend who doesn't program:

**Template:**
"So there's this problem where I have _______ and I need to find _______. The tricky part is that I have to _______, but I can't _______."

### Exercise 2: Input/Output Examples

Create 3 different examples for a problem:
1. **Simple case:** The most basic example
2. **Edge case:** What happens at the boundary?
3. **Complex case:** A more realistic scenario

**Example for "Two Sum":**
1. Simple: `[2, 7], target = 9` ‚Üí `[0, 1]`
2. Edge: `[3, 3], target = 6` ‚Üí `[0, 1]`
3. Complex: `[3, 2, 4, 6, 1], target = 8` ‚Üí `[2, 3]`

## üöÄ Challenge: Analysis Before Action

**Rules for this challenge:**
1. Spend 10 minutes analyzing BEFORE writing any code
2. Write down your analysis using the framework above
3. Only then start coding

1. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock
2. Maximum Subarray
3. Valid Palindrome

**Analysis Template:**
```

## ‚úÖ Success Checklist

Before moving to the next lesson, make sure you can:

- [ ] Read a problem and identify inputs/outputs clearly
- [ ] Spot the key constraints and requirements  
- [ ] Recognize if it's a searching, sorting, or counting problem
- [ ] Come up with at least one approach (even if brute force)
- [ ] Think of 2-3 test cases including edge cases
- [ ] Explain the problem in your own words

**Remember:** Great programmers aren't those who code fast - they're those who understand the problem deeply before they start coding!
